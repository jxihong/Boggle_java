Java Networked-Boggle Game
===================================

Written By: Joey Hong

This is a program that simulates the game Boggle using Java, following the CS11 Advanced Java Track
(http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/advjava/index.html)

The TestNG testing framework, Log4j logging, and Apache Ant were used in building the project

----------------------------------------------------------

To build the project, type 'ant' into the bash, which will generate the .class files, test files, and javadoc API documentation. The created files can be found in the created directory build/

The build/ directory will have the following subdirectories after the build script:

*classes/ - this contains the generated .class files
*tests/ - this contains the compiled test programs
*results/ - this contains the results of running testng on the test files
*javadoc/ - this contains the generated API documentation

You can also build them separately by typing in the bash 'ant compile', 'ant test', or 'ant javadoc'. The command 'ant clean' will remove the build directory and all files within in.

-----------------------------------------------------------

To play the game, you must first run the Boggle server with:
   
java BoggleServerApp

Then, to log into the server as a client, type into the bash:

java BoggleClient <username> <hostname>*

where the hostname defaults to localhost. Once over 2 users log into the server, the server will wait 15 seconds before starting the game.
